In an effort to get better at JavaScript and ES6 I'm building a calculator under the mentoring of Dave Berner. See the Issues section to see what’s left to do.

The calculator is a simple four function calculator and is modeled of the Basic variation of the OS X calculator. Please log any bugs here 
I’ll be doing my best to make this calculator accessible as accessibility on the Web is important to me.

As a sort of fun experiment I used CSS viewport units for the entire calculator UI so it’ll always take up the entire width and height of your viewport. I was tempted to put a max-width on the calculator but thought ‘what the heck’ let it keep going. So launch it on your smart TV and see the world’s largest on-screen calculator
